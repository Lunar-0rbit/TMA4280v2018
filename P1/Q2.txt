Question 2: 
Why do you think such tests may be useful wwhen parallelizing your computational code?
Answer: 
We can easily check, if the data transfer between the active processing cores functions as
intended. While the ecexutable serial code is easily checked for logical errors, one coul
miss a bug in the data transfer.
